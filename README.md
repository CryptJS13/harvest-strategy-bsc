# Binance Smart Chain: Harvest Strategy Development

This [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) environment is configured to use Mainnet fork by default and provides templates and utilities for strategy development and testing.

## Installation

1. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

## Run

All tests are located under the `test` folder.

1. Run `npx hardhat test [test file location]`: `npx hardhat test ./test/pancakeswap/cake.js`. This will produce the following output:
  ```

## Develop

Under `contracts/strategies`, there are plenty of examples to choose from in the repository already, therefore, creating a strategy is no longer a complicated task. Copy-pasting existing strategies with minor modifications is acceptable.

Under `contracts/base`, there are existing base interfaces and contracts that can speed up development.
Base contracts currently exist for developing SNX and MasterChef-based strategies.

Note that the Universal Liquidator will not be available on BSC until a later stage of this project.

## Contribute

When ready, open a pull request with the following information:
1. Instructions on how to run the test and at which block number
2. A **mainnet fork test output** (like the one above in the README) clearly showing the increases of share price
3. Info about the protocol, including:
   - Live farm page(s)
   - GitHub link(s)
   - Etherscan link(s)
   - Start/end dates for rewards
   - Any limitations (e.g., maximum pool size)
   - Current pool sizes used for liquidation (to make sure they are not too shallow)

   The first few items can be omitted for well-known protocols (such as `curve.fi`).

5. A description of **potential value** for Harvest: why should your strategy be live? High APYs, decent pool sizes, longevity of rewards, well-secured protocols, high-potential collaborations, etc.

## Deployment

If your pull request is merged and given a green light for deployment, the Harvest team will take care of on-chain deployment.
